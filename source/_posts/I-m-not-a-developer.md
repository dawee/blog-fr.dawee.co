... or at least I don't feel like it.


Six years before now I became what they call a **front developer**.
And after six years it feels more like **the obedient boy/girl who talks JS** (or at least in French companies).


First I don't like what they've done with the Web.
Web used to be a simple, unix, KISS thing.
With **Backbone** I was kind of happy.

Backbone did one thing and dit it well.


When the **Angular** craziness started it was for me the begin of misunderstanding.
What is so cool about rewriting the standards ? What is so cool about evaluated code into node attributes ?
But it did work for a big majority of developers. It WAS a big success. And yet, it keeps being applaused by a lot of people.


Not me. Maybe because **I'm not a developer**.


A couple of months ago I started to be curious about **facebook / flux** stuff.
The idea was interresting. I like when people draw their ideas on a whiteboard before writing any code.


But then ... REDUX OCCURRED and ... I mean ... WTF PEOPLE ?

```js
const FOO = 'FOO';
const BAR = 'BAR';
const THAT = 'THAT';
const FUN = 'FUN';
const EVERYTHING = 'EVERYTHING';
const I_WRITE = 'I_WRITE';
const ON_THE_LEFT = 'ON_THE_LEFT';
const IS_ALSO = 'IS_ALSO';
const ON_THE_RIGHT = 'ON_THE_RIGHT';
```

When exactly _this_ became a good idea ?


But exactly like for Angular, it's a HUGE success. And I mean like HUUUUUUGE.
So huge that now, if you look for **React** stuff, you find his buddy redux in the dependencies.

The problem is, I think I like React. Writing components is actually fun.
Prototyping with **create-react-app** feels really comfy.
But if you enter the React area, you have to sympathize with his annoying friends :

* John Redux
* Jack NowWellWriteClassUpperCamelCase.js
* Jude all-my-css-is-now-in-style-attributes

People seems to be happy with his friends but not me.

I miss the HTML / CSS / JS separation.
I miss the *router + DB* at server side, and the *dynamic stuff only* at front side.

But I don't want to kill people happiness.
Just maybe it's not for me.
Maybe **I'm not a developer**.
